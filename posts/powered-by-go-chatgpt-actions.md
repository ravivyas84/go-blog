I always believed that the best way to learn a language is to build a static blog builder. I used it to get started with NodeJS, NextJS and now I decided to do it again to learn Go and GitHub actions and use ChatGPT along the way. 

 A few quick thoughts, chatGPT is great for writing code, as long as you are willing to debug a lot of it. It makes typing feel like manual labour.

Go lang has been fun and fast. I figured I as well learn the basic of GO since I am going to around a lot of tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

I decided to stick with Vercel because of their great developer experience. But that did mean I needed to use GitHub actions to build the site, again that is a bonus since I manage a CI tool as my day job.
